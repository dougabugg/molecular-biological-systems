This is such a massive "rabbit hole", it feels very overwhelming. When I initially had the idea of creating this
repository, I just wanted to make a database, where you could look up a molecule, like "serotonin", and find which
cells in the human body it can interact with, and what results from an interaction. Then I get stuck into reading
about the GROMACS project, and molecular dynamics, but that's not what I want this project to be. I know other
software exists for doing simulations, and they've been optimized by more people and for much longer than I can
ever accomplish on my own. So what exactly is my goal in making this project? I want to try and give "structure"
and "meaning" to all this arbitrary data. Yes, Serotonin has the chemical formula "C(10) H(12) N(2) O", and a myriad
of other properties, but how does it fit into a biological system as a whole? What occurs inside of a cell when
serotonin binds to it's receptors, and what is the result on the local tissues and the host/macro organism?

When I go into wikipedia, and read the article about serotonin, there's this table with the name "Binding profile
of serotonin", which lists all these "meaninglessly" named receptors, like "5-HT1A" or "5-HT2B", and even more
"meaningless" statistics and units for "inhibition constant (Ki)" or "dissociation constant (Kd)" in "nanomolars
(nM)". I will admit, there's a lack and disconnect in my understanding of biology and chemistry; but I don't need
to deeply understand "organic chemistry" to understand certain higher-level concepts about biology, like "cell
respiration", or "DNA/RNA transcription". That is the goal of this project, to try and link together these high-
level concepts, and encode the most general rules and relationships in some sort of data base or data structure,
that then let's my curious mind ask questions like "what is actually going on when X Y and Z happen?", and sift
thru this gigantic model and attempt to come up with some "theoretical explanation".

It's so difficult for me to start building something this abstract; I find myself wanting to build something like
GROMACS, but that's not a productive use of my time, and doesn't help me answer these high-level conceptual
questions. Really, this thing I'm trying to build is sort of an information organization framework, with the
ability to create and follow links between items and nodes, and make "queries". It's such an abstract definition,
I don't really know how to begin coding!

I didn't end up writing any code for this project today. But I'll at least push the notes I've taken on the topic
so far. In the event that I think about this again in the future, and want to build some sort of "tool" to help
me navigate the massive complexity of molecular biology, maybe I'll find these notes again, and it will help me
start writing some code.
